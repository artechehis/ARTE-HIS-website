The May 14, 2007 National and local elections gave birth to a new administration. Dr. Rolando Baldelobar Evardone assumed the office of the Municipal Mayor as the eight (8th) elected Mayor of the municipality of Arteche. On the May 10, 2010 and May 13, 2013 succeeding National and local elections Mayor Evardone won another fresh mandate from his constituents. It was during the time of Mayor Rolando Evardone that all Barangays of Arteche were able to have access to electricity. In addition, then Mayor Rolando Evardone made sure far flung Barangays will have an easier access to secondary education, thus, he opened Carapdapan and Concepcion National High School. It was also during his time that the Rural Health Unit building was constructed and the health centers for Carapdapan, Central and Tangbo were constructed. In addition, farm to market roads from Tangbo-Bato, Carapdapan-Liliwitan, Campacion-Tebalawon. Barangay covered courts of Carapdapan, Central and Tangbo were also constructed.
What we have now manifests progress and sustained development of our municipality. The essential infrastructures, improved educational programs and social services, accessible health facilities, 100% energised Barangays, farm to market and access to market roads, stability of peace and order and the transportation and communication facilities would not be possible without the concerned efforts of Artechehanons, the competent leadership, the worthy and incomparable contributions and priceless efforts of our local leaders since 1951 to present.
Furthermore, the concreting of the national road to Arteche is one of the great things worthy of emphasis and due recognition from Artechehanons for that noble efforts and commitment of Congressman Ben P. Evardone. This realisation of our peopleâ€™s aspirations for easy access and convenience in our land transportation system has significantly affect our local economy and in shaping the development history of this municipality. This facility gives us a new dawn for a great new day for it brings us closer to the achievement of our common vision for Arteche as the Commercial Center in the North-East part of Samar Island, under a systematic, relevant and concrete roadmap to development provided for under the Comprehensive Development Plan of the administration.
On June 30, 2016, the three consecutive terms of Mayor Rolando B. Evardone has ended but his legacy remained in the heart of his people.</p>
